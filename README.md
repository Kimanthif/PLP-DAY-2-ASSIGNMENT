Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?

Version control systems enable software developers to track every change made to a code. Through VCS(Version control systems), it is possible to view the entire history of a code from who made changes, what changes were made and the time the changes were made. VCS also enable collaboration, by enabling multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously without overwritting each other's work. Github is a popular VCS because it is user friendly and fosters collaboration among developers. VCS helps in maintaining project intergrity through its ability to track all changes made on a code i.e by providing history of a code, it is possible to track who made changes on a code.



Describe the process of setting up a new repository on GitHub. What are the key steps, and what are some of the important decisions you must make during this process?

One must be logged in Github in order to create a new repository. 
On the left-upper corner, below the the dashboard, you will find a green icon that says 'New'.
This is where all other repositories are also listed. If this is the first repository, there will be no others listed.
Once you click on new, there is a new page that opens. This page contains all important fields marked in (*) asterick that must be filled so as to create the repository. Choose an 'owner'. This is the account that will be identified to with the repository. Add the repository's name. Here, Github will allocate the name according to its availability. If the repository's name is not available, you'll get an error that the name has been taken, prmpting you to choose another name. One can add a description of the repository which is optional. This is to briefly describe the repository that you're creating. Next, one chooses if the repository will be 'public' or 'private'. Basically this is to choose if the public will have access to your repository or it will only be visible to you as the developer. Select 'initialize this repositry with a README.md file'. This creates a repository with a readme file. lastly, click on create repository to create the repo.

Discuss the importance of the README file in a GitHub repository. What should be included in a well-written README, and how does it contribute to effective collaboration?

Compare and contrast the differences between a public repository and a private repository on GitHub. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each, particularly in the context of collaborative projects?

Detail the steps involved in making your first commit to a GitHub repository. What are commits, and how do they help in tracking changes and managing different versions of your project?

How does branching work in Git, and why is it an important feature for collaborative development on GitHub? Discuss the process of creating, using, and merging branches in a typical workflow.

Explore the role of pull requests in the GitHub workflow. How do they facilitate code review and collaboration, and what are the typical steps involved in creating and merging a pull request?

Discuss the concept of "forking" a repository on GitHub. How does forking differ from cloning, and what are some scenarios where forking would be particularly useful?

Examine the importance of issues and project boards on GitHub. How can they be used to track bugs, manage tasks, and improve project organization? Provide examples of how these tools can enhance collaborative efforts.

Reflect on common challenges and best practices associated with using GitHub for version control. What are some common pitfalls new users might encounter, and what strategies can be employed to overcome them and ensure smooth collaboration?
